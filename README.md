This repository contains the source code mentioned during my presentation: "Android, Arduino, and the Headphone Jack", which i sfeatured on SpeakerDeck and SlideShare. 
The slides can also be found on my Website here: https://wolfpaulus.com/more-talks/

There are quite a few 3rd party devices that attach to a smartphone's 3.5 mm headphone jack, 
Square's Credit Card reader, being just one of them. 

We will reveal the magic behind this cool innovative trick, explain how it was done and how 
your mobile app too, could take advantage of the headphone jack. Hijacking power and bandwidth 
from the mobile phone's audio interface. Come to see and learn how mobile app take advantage 
of a smartphone's headphone jack.

We will use "phone to phone" as well as Arduino to Android examples to demonstrate and explain 
this cool and innovative communication channel, and you may even pick up a couple 
DSP (Digital Signal Processing) basics along the way.
