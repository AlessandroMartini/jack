There are quite a few 3rd party devices that attach to a smartphone's 3.5 mm headphone jack, 
Square's Credit Card reader, being just one of them. 
We will reveal the magic behind this cool innovative trick, explain how it was done and how 
your mobile app too, could take advantage of the headphone jack. Hijacking power and bandwidth 
from the mobile phone's audio interface. Come to see and learn how mobile app take advantage 
of a smartphone's headphone jack.

We will use "phone to phone" as well as Arduino to Android examples to demonstrate and explain 
this cool and innovative communication channel, and you may even pick up a couple 
DSP (Digital Signal Processing) basics along the way.

Presentation slides are in this file: jack.pdf
Arduino sketches are in Arduino/sketch_1 (tone demo) and Arduino/sketch_2 (light sensor)
Android Jack application source is Android directory.
